    <h2 class="w3-wide">ABOUT <strong>ESCAPE</strong></h2>
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong>ESCAPE</strong> is much more than just a website of references;
it's a community of people who are passionate about educating themselves as well as others on the art of self defense.
 The overall goal of <strong>ESCAPE</strong> is to ensure that even the most vulnerable of people understand that there are always self-sufficient means of resisting
attacks by a suspected/unsuspected aggressor. We want people who once felt like they were weak and defenseless to realize that they are more powerful than they know,
 hence our slogan "<strong> Be Your Own Hero</strong>"</p>
  <p>A more specified goal here at <strong>ESCAPE</strong> is also to raise awareness of the widespread physical/sexual assault and domestic violence faced by people today in our nation.</p>
    <p>These statistics show how much of a problem this poses to our society as a whole, and it reminds us that we still have a lot of work to do to help tremendously reduce violence in America.</p>

   it is very effective if you're ever in a vulnerable position where kicking your attacker is your best or only option.
  It fits into the laces of your shoe on the top of its tongue.

  Apple emergency button in the iphone
  If you happen to own anything below the iphone 7, you’re in luck because in case of an emergency press the side of your button very rapidly 5 times. This method will call 911.
  If have an iphone X, 8, or 8 plus press and hold the side button and the volume button until the Emergency SOS appears.
                                                <strong>BOTH OF THESE WILL DO THE FOLLOWING….</strong>
  Make sure to update your emergency contacts/medical ID because after the calls ends your iphone will send whoever the you insert  emergency contacts  a text message with your current location.
  Your location will get updated every 10 min
  <p> If you have an <strong>Android</strong> phone however, <strong>there's no need to fret!</strong> Samsung developed a similar SOS feature for their Galaxy phones. When in an emercency situation, just three quick taps of your power button
will allow your phone to immediately send pictures from your front and rear camera to a set of emergency contacts.
